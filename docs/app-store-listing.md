## 1. App Name (max 30 chars)

**Recommended:** `360Ghar: Real Estate & Homes` *(28)*

Leads with the brand, then the two highest-volume head terms ("real estate", "homes"), which
become indexed for search. Alternatives:

| Option | Chars | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `360Ghar: Real Estate & Homes` ✅ | 28 | Best keyword coverage + clean brand. |
| `360Ghar: Buy, Rent Property` | 27 | Action-oriented; indexes buy/rent/property. |
| `360Ghar – Property in 360°` | 26 | Differentiator-forward (the 360° hook). |

Keep the brand token as `360Ghar` (no space) in the store name for compactness; the in-app
display name remains "360 Ghar".

---

## 2. Subtitle (max 30 chars)

**Recommended:** `Buy, rent & tour flats in 360°` *(30)*

Adds **new** keywords not already in the name (buy, rent, tour, flats, 360) — Apple indexes the
subtitle, so it should never repeat name words. Alternatives:

| Option | Chars | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Buy, rent & tour flats in 360°` ✅ | 30 | Max keyword pickup + the 360° differentiator. |
| `Swipe to find homes in 360°` | 27 | Highlights the signature swipe UX. |
| `Flats & villas with 360° tours` | 30 | Property-type heavy. |

---

## 3. Promotional Text (max 170 chars — editable any time without review)

```
Step inside every home in immersive 360°. Swipe verified flats, villas & plots, see them on the map, and book a visit in seconds — your dream home starts here.
```

Use this slot for time-sensitive pushes (e.g. "New listings in Gurugram this week") since it
updates without a new build.

---

## 4. Keywords (max 100 chars — comma-separated, NO spaces)

```
property,apartment,house,villa,plot,2bhk,3bhk,housing,realty,broker,agent,pg,room,resale,lease,sale
```
*(99 chars)*

ASO rules applied:
- **No spaces** after commas (spaces waste characters).
- **No repeats** of words already in the App Name (real, estate, homes) or Subtitle (buy, rent,
  tour, flats, 360) — those are already indexed.
- **No competitor trademarks** (e.g. MagicBricks, 99acres, NoBroker, Housing) — Apple can reject
  metadata containing them.
- Singular forms (Apple matches close variants); high-intent India terms (2bhk/3bhk, pg, resale).

If you change the Name/Subtitle, free up the now-duplicated words and add candidates from the
bench: `furnished,society,duplex,studio,builder,tenant,landlord,flatmate,independent`.

## 5. Description (max 4000 chars — ready to paste)

improvements" alone.

---

## 7. Categories

- **Primary:** Lifestyle *(the standard category for real-estate apps like Zillow / Realtor.com
  — the App Store has no dedicated "Real Estate" category)*
- **Secondary (optional):** Business

---

## 8. Age Rating — target 4+

Run Apple's content questionnaire and answer **No** to every objectionable-content question.
One question needs care:

- **Unrestricted Web Access → No.** The in-app WebView loads only curated 360° tour URLs, not an
  open browser. Answering "Yes" would force a 17+ rating. (If you ever add free web browsing,
  revisit this.)

Result: **4+**.

---

## 9. URLs

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Privacy Policy URL *(required)* | `https://the360ghar.com/privacy-policy` | Must be live & public. The in-app policy is fetched dynamically from the backend, so verify a public web page exists at this URL before submitting. |
| Support URL *(required)* | `https://the360ghar.com/support` | A real page with a contact method (email/form). |
| Marketing URL *(optional)* | `https://the360ghar.com` | Brand landing page. |

## 10. App Review information

Login is **phone + OTP** (Supabase auth), so App Review **must** be given a way in or the
build will be rejected under Guideline 2.1.

  After login, the home feed shows properties to swipe. Tap a card to open details and the 360°
  tour (loads over HTTPS — please ensure network access). Location permission is used only to

  user uploads images/videos to a listing. The app does not use tracking/IDFA.
  ```
- **Contact:** name, phone, and email of someone who can answer reviewer questions.

## 11. Hindi localization (en-IN primary; add hi as a localization)

The app ships English + Hindi, so add a Hindi (`hi`) App Store localization to lift discovery
and conversion with Hindi-first users. Keep the App Name as `360Ghar` (brand).

| Field | Hindi |
|---|---|
| Subtitle (≤30) | `360° टूर के साथ घर खोजें` |
| Promotional Text | `हर घर में 360° में कदम रखें। फ्लैट, विला और प्लॉट स्वाइप करें, नक्शे पर देखें और एक टैप में विज़िट बुक करें।` |
